# UD CSSA Training Sessions

Instructor: Kyungmin Lee (Acting President)

## Fall 2022 Training Session - Geospatial Analysis

1. Title: "Geospatial Analysis in Python"

2. Data: Open Data from the World Bank

3. Using Case: Geospatial analysis helps to see different data sets by country level. Using population, GDP, and CO2 intensity data from the World Bank, we will learn how to plot the world map and how to use spatial join methods to merge the map and specific data we want to explore. We will learn the basic methods to change colors, make color bars, and set quantiles to plot maps effectively.

4. Learning Objectives:

* Learn how to read in GeoDataFrame into python and understand the core packages used in the data analysis/data science stack along with other aspects of data cleaning (e.g. population, GDP).

* Learn how to read in Pandas DataFrame into python to plot the data we want to explore (e.g. CO2 intensity).

* Learn how to spatial join the GeoDataFrame and Pandas DataFrame by using different methods(e.g. how='inner' or 'outer').

* Learn data visualization using different color maps, color bars, and schemes.

## Spring 2023 Training Session - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion


1. Title: "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: the Basic Python Tools"

2. Data: Educational characteristics data from the Delaware government's open data platform

3. Purpose: As Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) issue is getting more important, this session aims to provide a training session to explore governmental DEI data and plot charts to see DEI status using basic tools in Python. This session aims to provide information about the DEI challenges and teach basic tools in Python to graduate students, especially from under-represented groups or countries with DEI challenges. 

4. Using Case: Using Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) data from the Delaware government's open data platform, how do staff race, gender, and educational level distributed in Delaware? Can we visualize the data to explore how it is equally distributed?   

4. Learning Objectives:

* Learn the DEI definition and challenges and find data from library and governmental open data platforms at the county, state, and national levels. 

* Learn how to load data from a governmental open data platform and understand the core packages. 

* Check statistics of the data set using basic tools and conduct data manipulation for analysis. 

* Learn how to run descriptive statistics & plot histograms and pie charts in Python, and interpret data results.
