# UD CSSA training

Title: "Geospatial Analysis in Python"

Data: Open Data from the World Bank

Use Case: Geospatial analysis helps to see different data sets by country level. Using population, GDP, and CO2 intensity data from the World Bank, we will learn how to plot the world map and how to use spatial join methods to merge the map and the specific data we want to explore. We will learn the basic methods to change colors, make color bars, and set quantiles to plot maps effectively.

Learning Objectives:

Learn how to read in GeoDataFrame into python and understand the core packages used in the data analysis/data science stack along with other aspects of data cleaning (e.g. population, GDP)

Learn how to read in Pandas DataFrame into python to plot the data we want to explore (e.g. CO2 intensity)

Learn how to spatial join the GeoDataFrame and Pandas DataFrame by using different methods(e.g. how='inner' or 'outer')

Learn data visualization using different color maps, color bars, and schemes.

Guidelines for the training:

If you wish to follow along please do the following:

Go to the UD Computational Social Science Shared Google Drive
Click on the folder "Python Training Code Notebooks"
Click on "Fall 2022" folder
Click on "Training 2. Geospatial Analysis in Python. 11.10.22" folder
Inside the folder you will see 2 python code notebooks (1 filled to completion and the other blank with comments annotated throughout) If you wish to follow along, please make a copy of the blank notebook into your own personal google drive, and follow along with the code as explained and conducted in the training session. The fully filled-out code notebook is for your reference.
